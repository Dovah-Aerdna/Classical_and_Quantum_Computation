ket: $|a\rangle$ are complex value column vector. Represent a point in an Hilbert Space.
Bra: $\langle a |$ are complex value row vector, dual of kets in HIlbert Space.


$$\langle a |=|a\rangle^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\a_2\end{pmatrix}^\dagger=(a_1^*, \ a_2^*)$$


If $U$ is a [[Unitary matrix|unitary operator]]: 

$$|\psi\rangle=U|x\rangle \qquad\implies \qquad \langle\psi|=\langle x |U^\dagger $$

Braket: $\langle a | b \rangle$ is the inner product.
ket bra: $|a\rangle \langle b|$ outer product

[[Qubits]] are represented by bra-ket notation. In particular a single qubit is a 2-state system, so it is described as a ket with just 2 components. 

Entries are probabilities amplitudes: their square is the probability of collapsing on the associated classical state.
