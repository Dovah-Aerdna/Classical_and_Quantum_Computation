Is a circuit made only by an inductor and a capacitor. Its Hamiltonian is:

$$H=\frac{1}{2C} Q^2+\frac{1}{2L}\Phi^2$$
Where $Q$ is the charge, $\Phi$ the flux, $C$ the capacity and $L$ the inductance. 
The characteristic frequency of the circuit is:

$$f_{_0}=\frac{\omega_{_0}}{2\pi}= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$
The Hamiltonian is practically the one of an [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic oscillator]].
Quantizing it,
$$\hat{H}=\hbar\omega_{_0}\left(\hat{n}+\frac{1}{2}\right)$$
the energy levels are at steps of:

$$\Delta E=\hbar \omega_{_0}$$
