There does not exist a unitary operation such that:

$$\forall |\psi\rangle \ : \ U |\psi\rangle|0\rangle=|\psi\rangle|\psi\rangle$$
where the state set $|\psi\rangle$ has dimension greater than 2. 
Observation: the theorem stress that the equality should be respected for all state. Consider as an example CNOT acting on standard basis. The behaviour is to clone a standard base, but using a general state will not work.
