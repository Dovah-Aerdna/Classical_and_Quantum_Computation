A **galactic algorithm** is one that outperforms any other algorithm for problems that are sufficiently large, but where "sufficiently large" is so big that the algorithm is never used in practice. For example, there are [[Asymptotic notation|asymtotically]] faster algorithms that [[Strassen algorithm]] for matrix multiplications, but they are never used in practice.
