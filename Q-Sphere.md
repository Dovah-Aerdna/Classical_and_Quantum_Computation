For 1-qubit:
- $|0\rangle$ is the north pole
- $|1\rangle$ is the south pole.

In this case the Q-Sphere is actually just 2 points. On each point is represented a blob, whose size represent the probability of measuring one state or the other. Furthermore, colors are added to describe the relative phase compared to the state $|0\rangle$.

For n-qubit:
- $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$ is the north pole,
- $|1\rangle^{\otimes n}$ is the south pole,
- all the other basis states are distributed on latitudes, ordered by hamming weight (number of ones) 

The same rules on the size of blobs and colours apply.
