There are various type of noise that can interfere with a quantum computation:
- [[coherent noise|coherent noise]]
- [[projection noise]]
- [[SPAM - State Preparation And Measurement]]
- [[incoherent noise]]
- coherent ZZ noise
- etc...


The summary of some principal error sources are summarized in the picture representing the results for $X^d|0\rangle$ (800 shots for every depth).

- coherent noise is responsible for the oscillations.
- projection noise gives statistical fluctuations.
- readout error results in an offset and a shrink.
- state preparation impact the [[fidelity]].
- incoherent noise (bitflip in this case) produce the exponential decay.
