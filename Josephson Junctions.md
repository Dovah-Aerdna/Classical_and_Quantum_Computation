Is like a capacitor made by [[superconductivity|superconducting]] metal: 2 layers of superconducting and in between a layer of insulator.

The crossed box is its circuit representation. The current is related to the sine of the phase between the two layers, and the energy to the cosine. [[superconductivity|Cooper pairs]] (electrons couples in superconductive regime) can tunnel through the insulator, creating nonlinearity in the current vs voltage relation.
