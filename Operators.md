Operators describes quantum [[Gates]].
represented by unitary square matrices:
$$U^{\dagger}U=UU^{\dagger}=1$$
This implies:

$$U^{-1}=U^{\dagger}$$
Geometrically, the unitarity correspond to:

$$||Uv||=||v|| \qquad \forall v\in \mathbb{C}^n$$
The rows and the columns of a unitary matrix form an orthonormal basis.

# Projection operator

Hermitian

$$\Pi = \Pi^\dagger$$
 and idempotent operator:
 $$\Pi^2=\Pi$$
 is a *projector*.
 For every unit vector $|a\rangle$, we can build a projector by taking the [[Bra-ket|outer product|]]:
 $$\Pi=|a\rangle \langle a |$$
Using an orthonormal set $\{ |\psi_i \rangle \}$ we can construct projector:

$$\Pi = \sum_{i=1}^n |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$$
Actually *every* projector has the previous form.
