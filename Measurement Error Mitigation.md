The measurement process is [[SPAM - State Preparation And Measurement|subjected to noise]] and can be described by the "$A$ matrix". The noise channel described by this matrix can be reversed by inverting the $A$ matrix, measured during calibration.

The technique "matrix free error mitigation", (Paul Nation et al 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12518) consist in computing a reduced matrix and finding an [[LU matrix decomposition]]. 

Another method is "twirled readout error extinction" (Edwout van den Berg 2022, https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09738)
