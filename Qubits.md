In abstract, qubits represent 2-levels systems, described in [[Bra-ket]] notation.
There are multiple ways to physically implement a qubit, for example:
- trapped ions
- [[superconducting loops]] or transmon qubits
- diamond vacancies
- silicon quantum dots
- topological qubits
- ...

[[Coherence|Coherence time]], [[noise|noise]], and other parameters describe a physical qubit.
