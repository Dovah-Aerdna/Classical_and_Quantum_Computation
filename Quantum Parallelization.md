#algorithm #classical 

Is an error suppression technique, and consist in designing during [[Transpiler|transpilation]] a circuit in order to run as much gates in parallel as possible, in order to reduce idle time for the qubits and avoid [[Coherence|decoherence]]. A classical example is a staircase structure (on the left) vs a brickwork structure (on the right) implementing the same circuit:

However a lot of parallel operations could suffer from [[crosstalk]].
