Quantum non-demolition measurement, refers to techniques that allows to extract some information from a quantum system (for example [[Josephson Junctions]]) without destroying the quantum state. (??? understand better)

A technique is the **quantum dispersive measurement**, which consist in coupling a qubit with a resonator (with frequencies NOT compatible), and measure the shift in the frequency of the resonator, not the qubit.
