Representation of a problem into an Hamiltonian. The problem can be physical, for example a simulation of [[Ising model]], [[fermionic Hamiltonian]], etc... or a general problem, for example [[travelling salesman problem]], etc...

Some techniques of mapping a fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian are:
- [[Jordan-Wigner mapping]]
- [[Bravyi-Kitaev mapping]]
- [[Parity mapping]]

There are also general reduction techniques such as [[circuit knitting]], [[wire cutting techniques]], [[causal light cone reduction]].
