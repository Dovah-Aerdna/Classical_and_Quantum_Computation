## Error Suppression

These techniques harness the physical properties of the system representing the quantum computation to reduce [[noise|errors]]. This type of optimization is usually performed during [[Transpiler|transpilation]]. Some examples are:
- [[Quantum Parallelization]]
- [[Pulse scaling]]
- [[Dynamical Decoupling]]
- [[Pauli Twirling]]
- [[Measurement Error Mitigation]]

## Error mitigation

These techniques consists in analyzing the circuit run in multiple ways. This type of optimization is usually performed during [[Transpiler|transpilation]] and/or using other analysis. Some examples are:
- [[ZNE - Zero Noise Extrapolation]]
- [[Probabilistic Error Cancellation]]
