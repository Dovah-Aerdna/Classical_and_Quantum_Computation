Superconducting loops are also called **artificial atoms** because can mimic the electromagnetic spectrum, can simulate real elements and of course, are "easy" to create thanks to semiconductor industry.

## Transmon qubits

A type of superconducting qubits is obtained replacing in an [[LC circuit]] the inductance with a [[Josephson Junctions]], the Hamiltonian is:
$$H=-E_J\cos (\Phi/\varphi_0)+\frac{Q^2}{2C_J} \approx \hbar \omega_{_a}a^\dagger a-\lambda a^\dagger a a^\dagger a$$

Which consider only the first order perturbation. This Hamiltonian describe with a good approximation the Josephson Junction and it's essentially an harmonic oscillator with a quartic perturbation, creating an uneven space in the energy levels.
