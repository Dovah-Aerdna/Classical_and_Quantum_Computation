Effects of noise produced without considering [[Coherence|decoherence]]. 
- coherent noise tend to have a quadratic worst case error (while [[incoherent noise]] is linear). 
- can be well described by unitary operations
- can create oscillations in data ([[Rabi oscillations]])

An example is obtained by considering [[noisy gates]]:

A real experiment, that take into account also decoherence, add a dumping and other [[noise]] sources.
