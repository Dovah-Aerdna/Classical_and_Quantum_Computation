## Measurement

A noisy channel can be described by some [[stochastic matrix]] matrix $A$, that relate the ideal outcomes to the noisy ones. This type of noise can be generated by imperfect apparatus:

$$P_{noisy}=AP_{real}$$
This type of error can be [[Measurement Error Mitigation|mitigated]] by analyzing the inverse of $A$.
For example for 2 bits, $A$ relates the measured $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ with the ideal ones:

$$A=\pmatrix{1-\varepsilon & \nu \\ \varepsilon & 1- \nu}$$

The effect of the noise is to  mix the ideal states as shown:

To quantify the deviation from the ideal case the *[[Fidelity|assignment fidelity]]* is introduced:

$$\mathcal{F}_a=1- \frac{\nu+\varepsilon}{2}$$
This value is zero if the readout is so noisy that it is completely undistinguishable from a uniform random sampling, i.e. from any probability of the ideal case, the probability of the readout would be the same (red line horizontal).
The effect of this error on a measurement is:

in particular the theoretical [[coherent noise]] readout gain an offset ed is shrinked. 

## State preparation

Can be described by a [[density matrix]] with some of the diagonal elements not $0$. For example, a 1 qubit density matrix representing a noise state preparation is:

$$\rho=\pmatrix{1-p & 0 \\ 0 & p}$$

where $p$ is the probability of being in the excited state, also called *thermal probability* or *thermal occupation*.
In a multiple qubit state, the tensor product of each bit prepared in a noisy way explain why it is difficult to scale to a huge number of qubits. Computing the state purity (the square of the density matrix), yields an exponential decay in the size of the system.
