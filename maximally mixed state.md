Even [[density matrix|statistical mixture]] of each individual basis states. 
A method to prepare a maximally state is to apply, for each qubit in the register that is going to be initialized in this state, the following:

i.e. preparing a [[Famous States|Bell state]] and then discard (without measuring) the second qubit (the target qubit, $B$).
