A collection of [[Operators|projectors]] satisfying:

$$\Pi_1+ \cdots + \Pi_m =\mathbb{1}$$
describe a projective measurement.
The outcome $k\in \{1, \cdots, m\}$ is obtained according to the probability:

$$Pr(k=\bar{k})=||\Pi_k |\psi \rangle||^2=\langle \psi | \Pi_k | \psi \rangle$$
and the state of the system collapse in:

$$\frac{\Pi_k | \psi \rangle}{||\Pi_k | \psi \rangle||}$$
All projective measurement can be implemented using unitary operations and standard basis measurement (change of basis).

A more general description on measurement is given by [[POVM]].
