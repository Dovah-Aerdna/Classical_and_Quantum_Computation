Allows to send 2 classical bits using a single qubit and burning an e-bit.

In a sense, is the reverse of [[Teleportation]].

It is interesting because the [[Holevo's bound]], that implies that 2 classical bits cannot be transmitted by a single qubit: the use of an e-bit is crucial.

It is a [[Famous States|Bell measurement]] performed after an appropriate manipulation of Alice's qubit. In [[Famous States]] there is a formula (that can be seen exactly as this circuit) that allow to get every Bell state from $|\phi^+\rangle$ applying _X_ or _Z_. This protocol, proceed to test which bell state was created by performing a Bell measurement.
